# simonSaysArduino
This is an Arduino project that uses 3 buttons, 3 LEDS, a Potentiometer, and an Arduino Uno to simulate a Simon Says game, where one LED lights up, and the player must guess the correct LED to win. Visit the README for the Tinkercad simulation link.

TO PLAY
1. Turn the potentiometer to a position less than 550 to start. Then press the red button to start. It takes a little fiddling. (While the game is idling before start, the three lights will light up rapidly and sequentially.)
2. When the game has started, one LED will light up. Guess the correct LED to win. If you win, all three lights will flash twice. If you lose, the red light will flash twice.
3. The game will continue looping, and the player continues to guess the correct lights.
